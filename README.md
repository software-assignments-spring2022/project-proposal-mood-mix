# Project Proposal

Project title:
Mood Mix 

_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

What and why:
An app that is catered to you and your mental health. The app will ask you intro questions regarding your music taste and mental health.
It will then make you various playlists for different mental health symptoms/needs based on these intro questions.
The app could have a function to link to and create these playlists in Spotify, Apple Music or whichever music platform you use.
There could also be a social media element to connect with others who are struggling with the same things or have similar music interests.

Music is very therapeutic and has many benefits when it comes to your mental health.
A lot of people struggle with mental health and symptoms from different mental illnesses.  
This app could cater to these individuals to help them to cope with some of their symptoms and/or feel a sense of connection to new music, new artists, or other users.

How:
The user will provide an email and password to create an account. They would then also provide information for genres of music and artists they already listen to, and answer questions based upon their mental health. We would then generate playlists for different moods based upon previously given information, and these playlists could be exported to other streaming platforms. They can like certain songs in the playlist, which would help in finding better music when the playlist is regenerated. Spotify's API gives detailed information about songs(rhythm, bars, beats, danceability), which would help place songs into playlists for different moods. Another option is to use musixmatch, which has lyrics and maybe with sentiment analysis, we can better classify songs for playlists based on content.

Scope:
A brief justification that the proposal is neither too easy nor too ambitions for a group of approximately 4 - 6 programmers to undertake in one semester.
