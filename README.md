# Project Proposal

Project title:
Mood Mix 

_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

What and why:
An app that is catered to you and your mental health. The app will ask you intro questions regarding your music taste and mental health.
It will then make you various playlists for different mental health symptoms/needs based on these intro questions.
The app could have a function to link to and create these playlists in Spotify, Apple Music or whichever music platform you use.
There could also be a social media element to connect with others who are struggling with the same things or have similar music interests.

Music is very therapeutic and has many benefits when it comes to your mental health.
A lot of people struggle with mental health and symptoms from different mental illnesses.  
This app could cater to these individuals to help them to cope with some of their symptoms and/or feel a sense of connection to new music, new artists, or other users.


For whom:
Those who are seeking self care tools or are trying to improve their mental health symptoms and enjoy music.

How:
A description of what the system will do from an end-user's perspective. Be as complete as necessary to fully explain the system, but do not worry about technical implementation - this will be developed in subsequent work.

Scope:
A brief justification that the proposal is neither too easy nor too ambitions for a group of approximately 4 - 6 programmers to undertake in one semester.
